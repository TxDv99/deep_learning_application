    "\n",
    "In this laboratory exercise we will learn how to work with the HuggingFace ecosystem to adapt models to new tasks. As you will see, much of what is required is *investigation* into the inner-workings of the HuggingFace abstractions. With a little work, a little trial-and-error, it is fairly easy to get a working adaptation pipeline up and running."
